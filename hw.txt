1. Set the texture coordinates correctly in sphere.js.  My face
   should be upright and looking to the left.  Once you have it right,
   switch image1.src (in view.js) to moon_diffuse.jpg.  You should now
   see a picture of the moon pasted on the sphere.

2. In index.html fragment shader, calculate ux, uy, and uz for the
   tangent frame from the (interpolated) vectors fNormal and fTangent.
   Select normal map for shading, and you should see a shiny grey
   sphere.

3. Set kd and ks from tex1 and tex2 using texture coordinate fTCoord.
   Normal map should now show shaded but smooth moon.

4. Look up the normal_color (encoding of normal as a color) in tex3
   using fTCoord.  Set n_ts (normal in tangent space) to decoded
   normal.  The moon should pop!

5. Set offset.x and offset.y to the x and y coordinates of the
   gradient of

      f(x,y,z) = z - h(x,y)

   Select height map for shading and slide depthScale to the left or
   right to see dents or bumps.
